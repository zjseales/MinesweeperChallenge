# MinesweeperChallenge
Personal challenge to create minesweeper in a variety of different languages.

### Java
The Java implementation was my initial attempt. I got stuck pretty early on and decided to follow a tutorial.

I have made a lot of improvements to this implementation which are described in the "MinesweeperJava/README.txt" file.
I hope to write all other implementations on my own but may end up referencing this initial attempt if I get stuck on what to do next.

### Unity
My second implementation. I referenced my previous attempt once to get the chainReveal function working.
I also used a tutorial to help me learn about GUI menus, my work from this tutorial is shown at https://github.com/zjseales/OnlineLessons/tree/main/MenuTutorialsUnity.

I've improved the previous attempt drastically. All improvements are described in the "MinesweeperUnity/README.txt" file.
