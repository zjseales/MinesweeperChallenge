# MinesweeperChallenge
Personal challenge to create minesweeper in a variety of different languages.

### Java
The Java implementation was my initial attempt. I got stuck pretty early on and decided to follow a tutorial.

Tutorial Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFpJp62ZoY8&list=PLGxHvpw-PAk6QvPw0fYe8bks31GRKvymK&index=1

I have made a lot of improvements to this implementation which are described in the "MinesweeperJava/README.txt" file.
I hope to write all other implementations on my own but may end up referencing this initial attempt if I get stuck on what to do next.
